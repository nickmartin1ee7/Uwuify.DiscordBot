# Uwuify.DiscordBot

This project started off as a joke when I created a pretty fast Uwuifier library ([Uwuify.Humanizer](https://github.com/nickmartin1ee7/Uwuify.Humanizer)).
It has since progressed into a learning experience for how to architecture a sharded discord bot and leverage Docker containers, Docker Swarm, and Seq.

This project isn't really meant for public use, but feel free to use it. No guarentees!
